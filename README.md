# Blockchain - Ajtai Hash Function

Blockchain Simulation using Lattice-Based Ajtai Hash Function

## Introduction

In this project, which is part of a Bachelor's thesis in Computer Science on the theme of post-quantum cryptography,
it is proposed to use a lattice-based hash function, better known as the *Ajtai hash function*,
instead of the standard SHA-256, in the implementation of a basic blockchain.

## Description

This blockchain simulation is composed of the following 5 Java classes :

- *Environment.java* (Main class)
- *Block.java*
- *Transaction.java*
- *Miner.java*
- *Utility.java*

## Future Work

Implementation of the signing process to guarantee the authenticity of transactions and the integrity of blocks
using a hash-based signature scheme (XMSS) to achieve a fully quantum-secure blockchain simulation.
